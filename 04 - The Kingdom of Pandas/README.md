### Heroes of Pymoli

Imagine that I got a data analyst position in a gaming company that developed a fantasy free-to-play online game **Heroes of Pymoli**. My task here is to analyze in-game purchases data for this game trying to uncover some trends and get meaningful insights on how the company could increase its profits.

## What is Inside

### Heroes of Pymoli

Note that my part is just to summarize and not sanitize the data (we assume that the sales department already provided us a clean dataset)

- The example file *purchase_data.csv* with incoming data
  
- A Jupyter Notebook *HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb* that contains Python code, all the necessary data breakdowns and some trends uncovered

- Also here is a screenshot of part of the analysis
