## What is this about?

### Heroes of Pymoli

Imagine that I got a data analyst position in a gaming company that developed a fantasy free-to-play online game **Heroes of Pymoli**. My task here is to analyze in-game purchases data for this game trying to uncover some trends and get meaningful insights on how the company could increase its profits.

Now I assume that I'm volunteer for the education department and my goal is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My goal is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
