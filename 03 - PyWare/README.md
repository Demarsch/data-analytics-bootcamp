## What is this about?

### PyBank

In this assignment, I'm tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of some company. I have a set of financial data called *budget_data.csv*. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The goal is to create a Python script that reads this data, calculates some specific statistics, prints this result to console and saves to the text file

## What is Inside

### PyBank

- The example file *budget_data.csv* with incoming data
  
- A Python script *py_bank.py* that does the job 

- The example output file *budge_data_financial_analysis.txt* that contains the financial analysis

- Also here is a screenshot of what this analysis looks like when printed to the console (VS Code terminal)
