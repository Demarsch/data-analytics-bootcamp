# What is this about?

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## What I have discovered

If you want to run a successful project on Kickstarter:
1.	It is better be a new rock song/album/band or a brand-new hardware device;

2.	Best time to launch the project is between April and June. Worst time is Christmas and New Year holidays/vacations;

3.	The less money you ask the more likely you will succeed.
