## What is this about?

As a Data Analyst, I've been given access to the complete data from the most recent animal study on drug-based anti-cancer treatment. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
